                I'm currently studying <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/computer-science-degree-bsc" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> at the University of Southampton.
                My degree has given me opportunities to study a large variety of fields including programming, computer vision and cyber security.

                        Most of my university work and personal projects get saved to <a href="https://github.com/tomhoad03" target="_blank">GitHub</a> as a way to access them more easily.
                        The language I use the most is Java but I am also fairly familiar with unique languages such as Haskell, Visual Basic and SQL.
                        I have self taught myself web development languages like HTML, Javascript, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery and JSON.

                        During Year 2 Semester 2 we finally returned to Java to create a <a href="https://github.com/tomhoad03/DistributedSystem" target="_blank">Distributed System</a> that facilitates file storage, reading and organisation.
                        This system implements methods of multithreading, distributed algorithms and other techniques being taught during the module.
                    </p>
                    So far, this has been the toughest and most in depth project that I have done so far.
                    It was a lot of fun to approach a more serious task that is used so often in modern infrastructures.

                        Further developing upon the Haskell we learnt in Year 2 Semester 1, we were set a task that has to have been one of my proudest.
                        The task was the create our own query language as a group of 3, resulting in the <a href="https://github.com/tomhoad03/CFlat" target="_blank">CFlat</a> language.

                        This product is used to display the performance of an ad campaign that is running and gathers data based off of impressions, clicks and conversions.

                    <p>
                        In my second year of University, we have begun to look at different styles of programming such as functional programming.
                        During the first semester we were taught <a href="https://github.com/tomhoad03/HaskellChallenges" target="_blank">Haskell</a> and given coursework and exercises for learning this language.
                        Now in the second semester, we are taking this further by creating an interpreter in Haskell for our own programming language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Haskell is a very different kind of language to what I've used in the path and is giving me a new perspective on problem solving and programming.

                        During my first year of University, I had to create a version of the game <a href="https://github.com/tomhoad03/MathDoku" target="_blank">MathDoku</a> (KenKen) using the skills I'd learnt in Java.
                        The coursework posed many challenges in multiple areas such as determining the logic of the game and displaying it as an application using JavaFX.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, it was a very enjoyable project to create, and I even had a chance to add a few bonus parts like a game over screen.
                        I was unable to create a solver for the game as it proved to great a logical challenge, but is something I would love to revisit someday.

                        Part of my coursework for A-Level computer science, I had to create a website that utilised both a front-end and back-end, using an API to communicate between the two.
                        Giving detailed documentation, I had to go through stages of analysis, design, development and evaluation, similar to methodologies used by professional developers.
                        My passion for Formula 1 and a new love for coding during this period motivated me to develop a website I am very proud of and was ultimately graded an A*.
