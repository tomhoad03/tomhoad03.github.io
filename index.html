                                I am a Computer Science MEng student at the University of Southampton in my third year.
                                University has given me opportunities to study a large array of modules including Computer Vision, Games Design and Development and Principles of Cyber Security to name a few.

                            <p>
                                During this time I have also had the opportunity to take part in 24 hour hackathons and online hackathons through Hack the Box.
                                My friends and I also partook in the Bloomberg BPuzzled competition which we won two years in a row and have been invited to the global finals on both occasions.

                                On my GitHub I have repositories for my university coursework, college work and personal projects.
                                Some of my work includes computer vision projects using OpenIMAJ libraries, video game projects developed in Unity and our own team developed programming language.
                                Throughout the last five years I have learnt a multitude of languages including Java, Haskell, C#, C++, SQL, Visual Basic, many web development languages and more.

                                The largest project I have ever attempted was an F1 Prediction Website.
                                Part of my coursework for A-Level computer science, I had to create a website that made using the client-server model with both a front-end, back-end and using an API to communicate between the two.
                                Giving detailed documentation, I had to go through stages of analysis, design, development and evaluation, similar to methodologies used by professional developers.
                                My passion for Formula 1 and a new love for coding during this period motivated me to develop a website I am very proud of that was ultimately graded an A*.
